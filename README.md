Hello, Collective!


There are plenty resources kicking about but this is some tips and pitfalls as I found them.

Setup:\
As the [setup guide](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) on the official Phaser site said, get set up for normal web development.\
I'm on a Mac so I use Unix commands in Terminal. (I intend to post an intro to commandline elsewhere)\
I use Visual Studio Code because it's new and sexy.\
Python came with my machine, as did it's local server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

When I'm scouring the web for assets I find these additional tools handy:\
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/crop/#crop_equal) is a venerable commandline image editor, you can automate cropping sprite sheets\
Or use a 'proper' image editor. Here's an online one called [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/web)
[Spriter's Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) for sprite sheets from games
Phaser hosts [a ton of other assets](https://labs.phaser.io/assets/) themselves.
Aaand if you want to download all of those instead of clicking each link, try the Chrome extension ['Image Downloader'](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj)

[]
For the particle demo (in the Readme of Phaser's GitHub as well as Phaser's site) it's pretty much a copy/paste of the code. You are encouraged to fiddle to understand the features.


And now the [first game tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game)\
One thing the tutorial does not explain clearly is the demo code links the assets to local folders you probably dont have. So either\
a) make them so the code works. Or\
b) edit the paths. Here you can select the text and hammer cmd+d to select the next occurences. Delete.
