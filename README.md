Hello, Collective!


There are plenty resources kicking about but this is some tips and pitfalls as I found them.

Setup:\
As the guide on the official Phaser site said, get set up for web development.
I use Visual Studio Code because it's new and sexy.
I'm on a Mac so I use Unix commands in Terminal. (I intend to post an intro to commandline elsewhere)

Want to download them all instead of clicking each link? I use a Chrome extension ['Image Downloader'](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj)

For the particle demo (in the Readme of Phaser's GitHub as well as Phaser's site) it's pretty much a copy/paste of the code. You are encouraged to fiddle to understand the features.
Notice the assets are linked in from a CDN (content delivery network), basically hosted online. If you follow the url to the parent directory you will be treated to a ton of other assets!

And now the [first game tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game)\
One thing the tutorial does not explain clearly is the demo code links the assets to local folders you probably dont have. So either\
a) make them so the code works. Or\
b) edit the paths. Here you can select the text and hammer cmd+d to select the next occurences. Delete.
